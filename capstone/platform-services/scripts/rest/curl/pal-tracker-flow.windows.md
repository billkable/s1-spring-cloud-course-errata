# Pal Tracker Distributed - Windows 

This article documents how to run PAL Tracker Distributed application
requests with cURL.

See [cURL Docs](https://curl.haxx.se/) for more information.

Beware running on Windows can be tricky,
notice escape characters.

Note the environment variable placeholders,
such as `${USER_ID}`, `${ACCOUNT_ID}`, etc.
They are not automatically correlated between requests,
so you will have to manually.

Extra credit if you author shell scripts to do the correlation!
